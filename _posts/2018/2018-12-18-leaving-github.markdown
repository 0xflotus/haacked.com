It used to be a tradition at GitHub to announce new hires with a blog post with the pattern, "So and so is a GitHubber." Each post would be accompanied by an image. [Here's mine](https://blog.github.com/2011-12-07-phil-haack-is-a-githubber/) with a photo of me with giant robot arms.

Over time, the images became animated gifs. And [these](https://blog.github.com/2013-11-08-rob-rix-is-a-githubber/) became [more](https://blog.github.com/2013-12-21-amy-palamountain-is-a-githubber/) and more [elaborate](https://blog.github.com/2013-09-06-jd-maturen-is-a-githubber/).

So it seems fitting that I use the same format for a post that announces I am no longer at GitHub. However, I don't have a clever animated gif to go along with it, so here's an image of Sad Keanu eating a sandwich.

If you follow me on Twitter, [this is old news](https://twitter.com/haacked/status/1053296117176184834). My last day was October 12, 2018. I've just been busy (or lazy) and haven't gotter around to writing about it till now.

## The Early Days

I hope you'll indulge me as I reflect back on my time at GitHub. It's relevant to what I'll be doing next.

I joined GitHub as employee number 50 (I believe I was the 54th employee if you count the four co-founders).

Part of what attracted me to GitHub was its unorthodox approach to running a business. This is exemplified in Zach Holman's series, [How GitHub Works](https://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works/):

1. [Hours are Bullshit](https://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-hours/)
2. [Be Asynchronous](https://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-asynchronous/)
3. [Creativity is Important](https://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-creativity)

GitHub at the time had no managers, was heavily distributed, had no set work hours, no deadlines, and so on. A lot has changed since then. As GitHub grew, it had to change how it worked accordingly.

## My Role

I [started at GitHub](https://haacked.com/archive/2011/12/07/hello-github.aspx/) on December 7, 2011. "Windows Badass" was the title for my position on the offer letter. That should give you an indication for how much GitHub cared about titles back then.

My initial project was to be a developer on GitHub for Windows,a GUI client for GitHub written at the time in C# and WPF.

![GitHub for Windows](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19977/50172223-66dd0480-02a9-11e9-9e7f-51675e32798b.PNG)

That product was part of a larger goal. The big reason GitHub hired me was to help make GitHub appeal to developers who code for Windows and the .NET platform. In retrospect, I think the Microsoft acqusition of GitHub indicates we were successful.

## Choose a License

Around this time, GitHub receieved a lot of criticism for how few projects have a license. The prevailing sentiment was that GitHub should add a license dropdown.

I pushed for this internally and remember the thoughtful feedback a colleague gave me. Those who understand open source licenses already know how to choose one and add it to their repository.

But for those who don't, a drop down list of obscure license names doesn't really help them. In fact, it could be dangerous as we're encouraging them to make a choice they don't understand.

This lead me to create (along with a fantastic designer, [Jason Longc](https://github.com/jasonlong)) [https://choosealicense.org](https://choosealicense.org) which I [wrote about back then](https://haacked.com/archive/2013/07/17/license-your-code.aspx/). This is a simple, opinionated, guide to how to choose a license. Once this was in place, we felt more compfortable adding a license drop down.

And based on this [third-party blog post](http://250bpm.com/blog:82), it had an effect! You can see a sharp uptick around the time launched the site.

After the uptick, the percentage continues to go down. It's hard to draw conclusions from that because the rate of growth of GitHub is so immense and most repos are not open source projects in the first place. They may be code samples, people futzing around, etc.

## Management

As GitHub grew, it reached a point where the company decided it needed managers to continue to scale.

Not long after, I became one of those manager types. I started off leading the Desktop team. Later on, I would become a Director and lead a group called Client Apps which consisted of four teams:

1. Atom
2. Electron
3. Desktop
4. Editor Tools.

My org was heavily distributed. We had people in nearly every timezone. We embraced asynchronous workflows.

But what I most enjoyed about my org was that I received a lot of feedback that people felt they belonged and were safe to do their best work.

This wasn't an accident. I was profoundly influenced by Project Aristotle, [Google's research into what makes teams effective](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html).

It became my mission to create a culture that promoted psychological safety not only because I believed it was the right thing to do, but also because I believed it made for teams that performed at a higher level.

I couldn't do this alone of course. I needed a diverse team of managers who also believed in this mission. At the time I left, my team consisted of three women (two of them women of color) and one man.

I don't mention this because I expect a cookie. What I expect is for more managers to stop making excuses when it comes to building diverse and inclusive teams. It's not only a just thing to do, but it [makes good business sense](https://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters).

## The Excuses We Make

Studies show that most interview techniques are [no better than flipping a coin](https://www.wired.com/2015/04/hire-like-google/). So if a coin keeps coming up heads, it's prudent to ask if the coin is weighted. Likewise, if hiring practices lead to a homogenous group, it's time to suss out the hidden biases in play.

Many leaders seem more intent on making excuses than putting in the work to learn and make it better. They blame the pipeline. And their leaders tolerate the excuses. Which is ironic because we'd never tolerate it when it comes to availability. [Who owns your availability?](https://www.whoownsmyavailability.com/) The same applies to your team's make up.

It does take extra work to overcome systemic biases and build a diverse and inclusive team, but it's worth it. The folks I got to work with were my greatest pleasure at GitHub.

## What's Next?

My six years and ten months at GitHub were an intense learning experience. I had the pleasure to work with some amazing people. It was wonderful.

But I'm also excited to take a break. My family had a [rough time in 2017](https://haacked.com/archive/2017/12/27/darkest-timeline/) from a mental health perspective, and while we're doing much better, staying that way takes a lot of work and vigilance. For example, we're homeschooling my son which is time consuming, but rewarding.

But I do have a little something something cooking that I'll write about soon.
